`Shield OAuth` helps you to provide the possibility of login or registering users through the OAuth service. Currently, `Shield OAuth` supports `Google OAuth` and `Github OAuth` by default, but it allows you to implement it for any other service, including **Yahoo**, **Facebook**, **Twitter**, **LinkedIn**, **GitLab** and ...

In `Shield OAuth`, it has been considered to be easy to use by developers and the possibility of expansion to connect to other services in the shortest possible time.
